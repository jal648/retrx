Experiments with rethinkdb

Using rethinkdb's ability to listen for changes, all the way to declaritvely bound markup.  

Example is a transaction feed.

Right now there's a lot of gluing together required to make it work.

inside fehi is a little python script which creates random transactions.  Wanted to wet my feet on using rethink with python as well.
